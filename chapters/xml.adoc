== Mapnik XML

[NOTE]
====
For now I'll only cover how to create styles using Mapnik XML style files. Documentation of other style file formats, like CartoCSS, or how to create styles purely programatically using C++ or Python code, will have to wait until the XML format documentation is complete, or for someone else to volunteer doing this.

=== DataSource

A `<Datasource>` can appear in two places: as a named data surce template under `<Map>` or as an actual data source in a `<Layer>`. A data soure template can provide default values for actual layer data sources, e.g. when using a PostGis database as data source a data source template can provide all the connection parameters, so that actual layer data sources only have to provide actual SQL queries.

Example:
[source,xml]
----
<Map>
  <!-- Datasource template ->
  <Datasource name="gis">
    <Parameter name="type">postgis</Parameter>
    <Parameter name="host">gis-db</Parameter>
    <Parameter name="port">5432</Parameter>
    <Parameter name="dbname">gis</Parameter>
    <Parameter name="user">maposmatic</Parameter>
    <Parameter name="password">secret</Parameter>
  </Datasource>
 
  <!-- actual Datasource using the template above for default values ..>
  <Layer name="layer-1">
    <Datasource base="gis">
      <Parameter name="table">
`       SELECT ...
      </Parameter>
    </Datasource>
  </Layer>
</Map>

Mapnik supports several different kinds of data sources, and actually has a plugin interface for these, so that plugins for more data sources can be added "on the fly" without having to rebuild Mapnik itself.

The set of plugins that come with Mapnik itself are caled core plugins. Some former core plugins that are no longer maintained, or never left experimental status, have been moved to a separate non-core plugins repository, and there is also a small number of plugins by outside contributores, which we will refer to as exra data sources below.

==== Core data sources

The core plugins are part of the mapnik source code itself, and usually avaliable in all builds of the mapnik library. (TODO: add link to mappnik github).

===== CSV

The CSV plugin reads simple column separated data from a file when specified using the `file` parameter, or directly from the XML style file when using the `inline` paramter. In the later case all lines following the `inline` parameter tag will be read as CSV input until the closing paramter tag is reached. In case that the inline data contains `<`, `>` or `&` characters, you should enclose it in a `<![CDATA[...]]>` section to prevent the content from being interpreted as XML.

When giving a `file` path, this is taken as relative to the directory the style file is in, unless a `base` parameter is given. In that case a relative `file` path will be interpreted as relative to the directory path given in the `<FileSource>` of that base name.

Processig performance can be improved by creating an additional `.index` index file using the <<mapnik-index>> tool.

.CSV data source examples
====
[source,xml]
----
<!-- read from file path/to/file.csv -->
<DataSource>
  <Parameter name="type">csv</Parameter>
  <Parameter name="file">path/to/file.csv</Parameter>
</DataSource>

<!-- read inline data -->
<DataSource>
  <Parameter name="type">csv</Parameter>
  <Parameter name="inline"><![CDATA[
lat,lon,text
52.0,8.5,"Bielefeld"
  ]]></Parameter>
</DataSource>
----
==== 

By default the CSV plugin tries to identify the field delimiter by looking at the first line of the file, checking for `,`, ´;`, `|` and the `TAB` character. Whatever of these characters seen the most often is considered the separator character, unless you specifcy a different one with the `separator` Parameter, e.g: `<Parameter name="separator">;</Parameter>`.

In cases where the data does not contain a header line, one can be given as content of the `headers` parameter.

The default quoting and escape characters are `"` and `\`, but can be changed with the `quote` and `escape` parameters.

Line endings are auto detected, too, so files with DOS/Windows (`\r\n`), Linux/Unix (`\n`) or MacOS (`\r`) style line endings are read correctly out of the box.

The CSV plugin assumes that the data it reads is UTF-8 encoded, a different encoding can be specified using the `encoding` parameter.

Column data can be referred to by the columns header name, using `[column_name]` placeholders in expressions. The following column names have a special meaning and are used to retrieve actual geometry data for a line:

`lat` or `latitude`:: Point latitude
`lon`, `lng`, `long`, or `longitude`:: Point longitude
`wkt`:: Geometry data in Well Known Text format
`geojson`:: Geometry data in GeoJSON format

So each input file either needs a `lat`/`lon` column pair, or either a `wkt` or `geojson` column to be used as a Mapnik data source.

When parsing the header line fails, or no geometry column(s) can be detected in it, the plugin will print a warning by default, and not return any data. When the `strict` parameter is set to `true`, style processing will be terminated completely by throwing a Mapnik exception.

===== OGR

The OGR input plugin supports a large number of different vector formats via the GDAL/OGR library. For a complete list of supported formats see the https://gdal.org/drivers/vector/index.html[Vector Drivers] list in the GDAL documentation.

The OGR plugin is typically used for GPX -- for which no special input plugin exists -- and OSM data -- for which it replaced the older OSM plugin that has now been moved to the `non-core-plugins` repository and is usally not included in Mapnik binary builds anymore. So we're going into details for these two data formats below only.

.OGR data source parameters
[width="100%",options="header",cols="m,d,d,d"]
|====================
| Parameter | Type | Default | Description 
| base | string | none | name of a <FileSource> to find the input file in

| layer | string | none | name of the input layer to actually process
| layer_by_index | int | none | number of the input layer to actually process
| layer_by_sql | | |
| string | string | none | alias for `inline`
|====================

====== OGR GPX

The GPX backend reads GPX XML files and provides the contained data via the following five layers:

routes:: 
    Returns routes from the GPX files `<rte>` tags as lines. Each route is given an extra `route_id` attribute.

tracks::
    Returns tracks from the GPX files `<trk>`/`<trkseg>` tags as multilines. Each track is given an extra `track_id` attribute.

route_points::
    Returns `<rtept>` route points from all routes, with an extra `route_fid` filed referring to the `route_id` of the route that a point belongs to.  

track_points::
    Returns `<trkpt`> track points from all tracks, with extra `track_fid` and `track_seg_id` attributes added.

waypoints::
    Returns a compbination of all route and track points.

Any extra tags that a route, track or point may have, like `<name>` or `<ele>` (for eleveation), can be accessed in filter expressions and symbolizers by name, e.g. as `[name]` or `[ele]`.

For more details see the https://gdal.org/drivers/vector/gpx.html[original GDAL documentation for the GPX backend]

====== OGR OSM 

The OGR plugin can read uncompressed https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OSM_XML[OSM XML] data andt the more compact, but not human readable, https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/PBF_Format[PBF format]. File formats are auto detected when using the `.osm` or `.pbf` file extensions. When using files with other extensions, like e.g. `.xml` for OSM XML, the `driver` parameter needs to be set to `osm` explicitly.

The OSM backend provides data in the following five layers:

`points`:: Nodes that have significant tags attached.
`lines`:: Ways that are recognized as non-area.
`multilinestrings`:: Relations that define a multilinestring (`type=multilinestring` or `type=route`).
`multipolygons`:: Ways that are recognized as areas and relations that form a polygon or multipolygon (e.g. `type=multipolygon` or `type=boundary`)
`other_relations`:: Relations that are not in `multilinestrings` or `multipolygons`

While rendering OSM data directly can work out OK for small amounts of data the usually preferred way to present OSM data is to import it into PostGIS using either the ((<<osm2pgsql>>)) or ((<<imposm>>)) import tool first, and then to use the ((PostGIS Datasource)). This  requires some extra effort up front, but performs better on larger data sets, and allows for more sophisticated preprocessing of the OSM input data than the few fixed rules statically built into the OGR OSM backend.

For more details see the https://gdal.org/drivers/vector/osm.html[original GDAL documentation for the OSM backend]

|====================

Aside from the basic PostgreSQL connection parameters (`host`, `port`, `user`, `password`, `dbname`), you can also add additional https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-PARAMKEYWORDS[connection parameter keywords] in the `host` or `dnname` parameter (probably the others, too, but this I didn't test yet) for more fine grained connection control.

You can e.g. set a datasource specific application name with this:
[source,xml]
----
<Parameter name='host'>localhost application_name=my_sytle</Parameter>
----

Or set a specific schema search path:
[source,xml]
----
<Parameter name='host'>localhost options='-c search_path=foo,public'</Parameter>
----

Probably most important though, this allows for using SSL/TLS. In it's most basic form you'd just enforce SSL/TLS encryption being used:
[source,xml]
----
<Parameter name='host'>localhost sslmode=require</Parameter>
----

The PostGIS datasource supports two different methods to return data to Mapnik: in regular well known binary (WKB) or -- with PostGIS v2.2 or later -- tiny well known binary (https://github.com/TWKB/Specification/blob/master/twkb.md[TWKB]) format. This is controlled by the `twkb_encoding` option. 

When using TWKB the `twkb_rounding_adjustment` parameter then controls the resolution the TWKB aims for. A value of 0.5 would lead to a coarseness of about one pixel, the default of 0.0 would be in the range of 0.05 to 0.2 pixels usually. This is done by using the `twkb_rounding_adjustment` parameter to calculate the `tolerance` paramter for https://postgis.net/docs/ST_Simplify.html[`ST_Simplify()`] and https://postgis.net/docs/ST_RemoveRepeatedPoints.html[`ST_RemoveRepeatedPoints()`], and the `decimaldigits_xy` parater for https://postgis.net/docs/ST_AsTWKB.html[`ST_AsTWKB()`]

When using WKB (the default), simplification can be controlled via `simplify_geometries`, `simplify_snap_ratio`, `simplify_dp_preserve`, `simplify_dp_ratio`, `simplify_prefilter`, `simplify_clip_resolution` parameters. (TODO: describe in more detail)

`simplify_clip_resolution` is use for both formats, and controls at what map scale geometries start getting clipped to the rendering window when non-zero.




The following special tokens can be used in SQL queries, and will be replaced b the actual mapnik values for the current render request:

`!bbox!`:: the map bounding box
`!scale_denominator!`:: the current scale denominator
`!pixel_width!`,`!pixel_height!`:: width and height of pixels (TODO: depens on STR, is ° with latlon and meters with google mercator?)

===== Shape

The shape input plugin can read the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile[ESRI shapefile format]. The OGR plugin also supports shapefiles, but the shape plugin has more direct support for this. It is also better maintained and tested.

Shapefiles are often used instead of databases for data that doesn't change that often, or where data available in a database requires some preprocessing. Common examples are boundaries, coastlines, and elevation countour lines.

OpenStreetMap or example provides land polygons, water polygons, coastlines, and antarctic ice sheet polygons and outlines as regularily updated shapefiles on the https://osmdata.openstreetmap.de/[OsmData Download Server]. Due to the way large bodies of land and water are constructed by grouping individual coast line segments into polygon relations in OSM, there's always a risk of such lines not really being closed polygons. The OSM shapefiles are generated by extracting and aggregating the line segments data, and are only published when containing no unclosed polygons.

Another often used source of shapefiles is https://www.naturalearthdata.com/[Natural Earth], which provides public domain geo data for lots of physical and cultural features.

Shapefile processing performance can be increased by creating an index file using the <<shapeindex>> tool that is included in the Mapnik source code, and usually also in binary distribution pacakges.

The https://github.com/mapnik/hello-world-input-plugin[Hello World plugin] is an example of the minimal code needed to implement an input plugin. It only ever returns a single point geometry located in the middle of the current map extent, with a single attribite named `key` and a constant value of `hello world!`.

=== FileSource

A `<FileSource>` can be used as a child of `<Map>` to declare named directory paths that can be referred to by the `base=...` attribute in symbolizers that are able to load image files, like e.g. `<PointSymbolizer>`, `<LinePatternSymbolizer>` etc.

|====================
| Attribute                 | Value | Default | Description

|====================



=== FontSet

A ((`<FontSet>`)) contains a list of or more `<Font>` entries that are searched in the listed order when rendering characters. This way a style sheet can specify multiple alternative fonts for different platforms, or different language specific fonts.

Listed fonts that do not exist on the system runnng Mapnik are simply ignored after generating a warning. Also when a certain character is not found in the first font the other fonts are searched in order until one supporting the character is found.

So when e.g. a map is to show both `<TextSymbolizer>` or `<ShieldSymbolizer>` using the ((`fontset_name`)) attribute.

.FontSet attributes

| buffer-size               | float | 0 |  
| cache-features            | bool  | false | On layers with multiple styles: read features from data source only once and cache them in memory. Improves perforance, but at the cost of using more memory, so off by default. 
| clear-lable-cache         | bool  | false | Clear the placement cache from previous layers, so that texts, points and markers may overlap with those from previous layers. 
| group-by                  | string | none | On layers with multiple styles these styles are processed one by one in the given order by default. When giving a group-by property, feature elements will be sorted by this property, and styles will be processed in order for each distinct group value. E.g with `group-by=z` and `z` having values from `-1` to `1`, first all features with `z=-1` will be processed using all styles, then all with `z=0`, and finally all with `z=-1`.
| minimum-scale-denominator | float | 0 | Minimum map scale above which this layer should be rendered.
| maximum-extent            | 4x float |  | Maximum exent for which features should be processed. 
| maximum-scale-denominator | float | max. float | Maximum map scale up to which this layer should be rendered.
| name                      | string | none | Name by which the layer can be refeenced, e.g. for error messaes.
| queryable                 | bool | false | unused? 
| srs                       | proj4 srs string | `+proj=longlat +ellps=WGS84 +datum=WGS84 +no_defs` | Spatial reference system
| status                    | boolean | true | Whether this layer should actually be processed or not. Caution: when set to `false` in XML the complete `<Layer>` will simply be skipped on reading the style file, and no layer object will be created for it. So you won't be able to enable such a layer with `Layer.set_status(true)` using API code later.

=== Style

Styles contain a set of rendering rules to render data elements provided by a data source. Each style can contain one or more rules for rendering specific features.

.Style attributes
[options="header",cols="m,d,d,d"]
|====================
| Attribute                 | Value | Default | Description
| comp-op | SVG compositing |  |  
| filter-mode | "all", "first" | "all" |  
| opacity | float | 1 |  
| image-filters-inflate | boolean | false |  
| image-filters | string |  |  
| direct-image-filters | string |  |  
|====================


=== Rule

A style rule filters data elements provided by a data source, and renders the matching elmements using one or more symbolizers. Rules can also be limited to specific scale factor ranges only, e.g. to implement different zoom level styles.

.Rule attributes
[options="header",cols="m,d,d,d"]
|====================
| Attribute                 | Value | Default | Description
| name | string | none |  
|====================


=== Filter

Filters specify on what data elements a rule should operate, by evaluating expressions. The expression language supports simple comparisons, logic, math, and regular expression matching.

There are also two special filters that do not evaluate expresions but depend on whether other previous filters in the style found a match:

<ElseFilter> matches if no other filter in a style matched so far, so it can be used as a fallback default.

<AlsoFilter> only matches if at least one previous filter in a style matched.

The `<Filter>` tag has no tag attributes.

==== Filter expressions

The filter expression language supports the following constants, operators, and functions. It also allows for referencing data element attributes by putting the attribute name in square brackets `[attribute]` and to change evaluation order by putting expression parts in regular round brackets `(...)`.

TODO: operator precedence
TODO: regular expression match and replace

===== Constants

`true`:: logical true
`false`:: logical false
`pi`:: 3.14159...
`deg_to_rad`:: 0.01745... (pi/180)
`rad_to_deg`:: 57.295... (180/pi)

===== Operators

`+`::
`-`::
`*`::

`and`, `&&`::
`or`, `||`::
`not`, `!`::
`=`, `eq`, `is`::
`!=`, `<>`, `neq`::
`<`, `lt`::
`\<=`, `le`::
`>`, `gt`::
`>=`, `ge`::
  ...

===== Functions

`sin(x)`:: Sinus
`cos(x)`:: Cosinus
`tan(x)`:: Tangens
`atan(x)`:: Arc Tangens
`exp(x)`:: `e^x^`
`log(x)`:: natural logarithm of `x`
`pow(x,y=`:: `x^y^`
`abs(x)`:: positive absolute value of `x`
`min(x,y)`:: minimum value
`max(x,y)`:: maximum value
`length(str)`:: string length



=== Symbolizers

Symbolizers do the actual rendering of map features. There are several different kinds of symbolizers that operate on point, line and polygon data objects to create visual representations on these. Below you will find detailed descriptions of the available symbolizers in alphabetical order.

[NOTE]
====
Right now all the symbolizer examples below show a complete XML style file. I'm considering to shorten these to just the actual symbolizer tag and the inline CSV data lines as the rest of these examples is actually redundant, to save some space, with hyperlinks to the actual full example files ...

==== BuildingSymbolizer

The ((`<BuildingSymbolizer>`)) renders polygons in a very simple pseudo-3D fashion. The givin fill color us used for the "roof", while its individual red, green and blue values are multiplied by 0.8 to create a more darkened tone for the "walls"

==== GroupSymbolizer

==== LineSymbolizer

The LineSymbolizer specifies how to render linear geometries like lines and polygon outlines. Most of the LineSymbolizer attributes define stroke attributes of the line to draw, like color, width, how line joins and ends should look, and even dash patterns.

There are also some attributes that change the lines geometry itself, like offset, smooth and simplify.

==== LinePatternSymbolizer

A LinePatternSymbolizer draws a given pattern image along a line, repeating the pattern as often as needed, and transforming it accordingly to follow the turns of the line.

[WARNING]
====
Even when giving the pattern as a SVG file, internally it will be converted to PNG before applying transformations to it to make it fit the line. So when creating SVG or PDF output, the result can still become a bit blurry when zooming in on LinePatternSymbolizer output.

==== MarkerSymbolizer

The MarkerSymbolizer is similar to the PointSymbolizer, but has two advantages when used on a line or polygon: it can be drawn multiple times along a line automatically, and it's orientation is rotated according to the current direction of the line instead of always being upright.

==== PointSymbolizer

The point symbolizer draws a given image at a point position. When given a line or polygon as input the shape will be put at the middle of the line or center of the polygon. 

If no image file is specified a small square is used as the default point image.

For putting symbols along a line or the edge of a polygon the MarkerSymbolizer is usually a better choice.

==== ShieldSymbolizer

A shield symbolizer is basically a combination of a point and a text symbolizer, making sure that both image and text are always shown at the same position, and that collision rules apply to both together instead of individually. The name stems from the original use case to show highway shields.

ShieldSymbolizer inherits almost all attributes from the <<TextSymbolizer>>, with a small number of additions and modifications.

.ShieldSymolizer spacing
====
`spacing` controls the distance between shields on a single line feature. When no spacing is given only a single shield will be attemted to be placed.

See also `repeat-distance`, which controls how far shields with the same text should be set apart in general, even when placed on different geometries.

`point`:: Places the shield just once at the center of the geometry. In case of a polygon that may actually be outside of the polygon surface, depending on its shape

`interior`:: Similar to `point`, but makes sure that the shield is placed inside a polygon even if its center point is actually on its outside

`line`:: When `spacing` is larger than zero the shield is repeatedly drawn along a line or a polygons outline with `spacing` pixels between shields

`vertex`:: Tries to place the shield on each vertex point of a line or a polygons outline

`grid`:: When `grid-cell-width` and `grid-cell-height` are greater than zero the shield is repeatedly drawn into a polygons surface, using grid cells of the given width and height. Note that the shield is not clipped at the border of the polygon, so some shield parts may be drawn slightly outside of the polygon surface.
