== Mapnik XML

[NOTE]
====
For now I'll only cover how to create styles using Mapnik XML style files. Documentation of other style file formats, like CartoCSS, or how to create styles purely programatically using C++ or Python code, will have to wait until the XML format documentation is complete, or for someone else to volunteer doing this.
